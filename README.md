# cura-build

This repository contains build scripts used to build Cura and all depenencies from scratch.

For every target platform, a Vagrantfile was created so the complete build process can be run inside of a virtual machine. This allows you to build for any target, no matter if you use Windows, OS X or Linux, and has the added benefit of keeping your computer clean because you avoid having to install lots of libraries and tools on it.

Look at the documentation for every target platform:
* [OS X](osx/README.md)
* Windows (to be written)
* Linux (to be written)
